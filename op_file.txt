Man says :  Is this the right room for an argument?
Other Man says :  I've told you once.
Man says :  No you haven't!
Other Man says :  Yes I have.
Man says :  When?
Other Man says :  Just now.
Man says :  No you didn't!
Other Man says :  Yes I did!
Man says :  You didn't!
Other Man says :  I'm telling you, I did!
Man says :  You did not!
Other Man says :  Oh I'm sorry, is this a five minute argument, or the full half hour?
Man says :  Ah! (taking out his wallet and paying) Just the five minutes.
Other Man says :  Just the five minutes. Thank you.
Other Man says :  Anyway, I did.
Man says :  You most certainly did not!
Other Man says :  Now let's get one thing quite clear: I most definitely told you!
Man says :  Oh no you didn't!
Other Man says :  Oh yes I did!
Man says :  Oh no you didn't!
Other Man says :  Oh yes I did!
Man says :  Oh look, this isn't an argument!
Other Man says :  Yes it is!
Man says :  No it isn't!
Man says :  It's just contradiction!
Other Man says :  No it isn't!
Man says :  It IS!
Other Man says :  It is NOT!
Man says :  You just contradicted me!
Other Man says :  No I didn't!
Man says :  You DID!
Other Man says :  No no no!
Man says :  You did just then!
Other Man says :  Nonsense!
Man says :  (exasperated) Oh, this is futile!!
Other Man says :  No it isn't!
Man says :  Yes it is!
